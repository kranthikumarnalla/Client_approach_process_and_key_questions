**My 7-Step Interior Design Workflow Simplified**

When I worked with interior design clients, my projects followed a streamlined 7-step process.

Here's an easy-to-follow guide to what each step involved and how it helped create a seamless client experience.

Step 1: Initial Consultation

 • Purpose: Every project started with a paid consultation to set the foundation.

Why this step is essential:

 • Clients get a clear way to start working with you (no confusing options).
 
 • You get to assess if the client and project are a good fit.
 
 • Clients can decide if you're the right designer for them.
 
 • It’s a low-commitment first step that makes saying "yes" easier for clients.
 
How I did it:

 • Booked the consultation: Pre-payment, emails, and a quick questionnaire to gather info.
 
 • Prepared for the meeting: Reviewed their needs and outlined how I could help.
 
 • Conducted the consult: Discussed their vision, provided advice, and explained next steps.

 • Developed a fee proposal: For clients who wanted to continue working together (about 90%).

Step 2: Onboarding

Purpose: Get the client set up, excited, and ready for the project!

How I impressed clients:

 • Sent a welcome video or message (a small gesture that makes a big impact).
 
 • Shared a professional Client Welcome Pack outlining the process.
 
 • Scheduled a kick-off meeting and site measure to get things rolling.
 
Pro Tip:

 • A polished onboarding experience sets the tone for the project and builds trust.

Step 3: Concept Development

Purpose: Create an initial design concept for the client to approve.

What this phase included:

 • Drafting ideas in tools like SketchUp and creating a Design Concept presentation.
 
 • Regular updates to the client so they felt involved.
 
 • Proofreading everything (no room for errors here!).
 
Key Tip: Always get a partial upfront payment before starting work.

Step 4: Documentation

Purpose: Dive deep into the details and create comprehensive plans for execution.

What I worked on:

 • Detailed design drawings, joinery plans, bathroom elevations, and furniture schedules.
 
 • Ensuring every document was error-free to avoid future confusion.
 
Why this step matters:

 • It’s the most time-consuming phase but also the one that sets the project up for success.

Step 5: Construction

Purpose: Oversee the building process and ensure the design is executed correctly.

How involved I was:

 • Some clients needed me onsite regularly; others were more hands-off.
 
 • I scheduled site visits, kept clients updated, and billed based on hours or a retainer.
 
Caution: Don’t take on tasks outside your qualifications (like full project management) unless you're licensed.


Step 6: Install & Styling

Purpose: Bring the vision to life with furniture, accessories, and styling.

My process:

 • Double-checked that everything was ready for install day.
 
 • Worked through a detailed checklist to ensure the final setup was flawless.
 
 • Handed over the project with a Client Handover Pack to wrap things up professionally.
 
Pro Tip:

 • Always invoice and get paid before starting the installation phase!

Step 7: Project Completion

Purpose: Wrap up the project and collect feedback for future growth.

What I did:

 • Arranged professional photography or took photos myself (especially early on).
 
 • Checked in with clients post-project to ensure they were happy.
 
 • Asked for reviews and referrals to build my portfolio.
 
Why it’s important: This step helps showcase your work and attract new clients.

**Final Thoughts**

Every project is unique, so not all steps will apply every time. Early on, I took on any project to build my portfolio and generate revenue.  I refined my process and focused on larger projects that required all 7 steps.

The key to success is delivering a high-quality client experience that makes clients thrilled with both the process and the outcome.

Your business, your rules: Adapt this workflow to suit your style, have fun with it, and always aim for excellence



# Essential Questions to Ask Your Interior Design Clients

1. What’s Your Budget?
   
Why It Matters:

 • Budget sets the tone for everything—from the scope of the project to the materials you can use.
 
 • Discussing money upfront saves everyone time and ensures expectations are aligned.

How to Approach:

 • Be clear and open: "What’s a realistic range for you?"
 
 • Break down costs for transparency: materials, labor, and design fees.
 
Outline payment terms: hourly vs. fixed rates, and when payments are due.

2. What’s Your Timeframe?
   
Why It Matters:

 • Time is a critical factor.
 
 • Some clients may underestimate how long quality design takes. 
 
 • Understanding their timeline helps you manage expectations and avoid stress.

Example Conversation:

Client: “We’d like to finish by the holidays!”

You: “Great! Let’s look at the schedule and determine what’s achievable within that timeframe.”

3. Have You Worked with a Designer Before?
   
Why It Matters:

 • This reveals their experience and expectations. If they’ve had a negative experience, it’s a chance to understand what went wrong and avoid similar issues.

Tip:

 • Be cautious if they complain excessively about past designers—it could be a red flag about their communication or expectations.

4. Who Makes the Decisions?
   
Why It Matters:

 • Clarity is key when working with couples or groups. Miscommunication can lead to delays and disagreements.

Pro Tip:

 • Ask this question with all decision-makers present to ensure agreement on the process.
 
For example:

 • One partner might control style, while the other handles finances.
 
5. What Do You Consider Expensive or Inexpensive?

Why It Matters:

 • Everyone values things differently. A $400 lamp might be reasonable to one client and extravagant to another. This question helps align your pricing with their perception.

How to Ask:

“What’s your budget range for a sofa?”

Repeat for other items like rugs, art, and lighting to understand their priorities.

6. How Did You Hear About My Firm?

Why It Matters:

 • Knowing where clients find you helps you refine your marketing strategy. Referrals are often the best clients, as they already trust your work.

Red Flag:

 • If they stumbled upon your name randomly and haven’t researched your style, they might not be your ideal client.

7. What’s Your Design Style or Vision?
   
Why It Matters:

 • If their style doesn’t align with your expertise, it might not be a good match. Trying to adapt to an unfamiliar style could lead to unsatisfactory results for both parties.

What to Do:

 • Encourage them to describe their vision. Use tools like mood boards or Pinterest to clarify preferences.

8. Do You Use Pinterest or Other Design Tools?
   
Why It Matters:

 • Pinterest boards are a goldmine for understanding your clients’ preferences. Encourage clients to share boards or start pinning ideas for their project.

Pro Tip:

 • Ask them to create a board for their dream space—it saves time and ensures you’re on the same page.

9. What Are Your Goals for the Project?
    
Why It Matters:

 • Understanding their goals sets the foundation for your design. Are they looking for functionality, aesthetics, or a combination of both?

Details to Clarify:

 • Which spaces are involved?
 
 • What’s staying, and what’s changing?
 
 • Do they need new additions or features like custom lighting or furniture?

10. Can You Show Me Examples of Designs You Like?
    
Why It Matters:

 • Seeing tangible examples minimizes miscommunication. Whether it’s photos, sketches, or magazine clippings, visual references make it easier to align your vision with theirs.

How to Approach:

 • Come prepared with samples from your portfolio to spark ideas and guide the conversation.
